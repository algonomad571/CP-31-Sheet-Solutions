# 🚀 CP-31 Sheet — Solutions Repository

This repository contains my **personal solutions** to problems from the **CP-31 Sheet** (Curated Competitive Programming Sheet).

The goal of this repo is not just to store accepted code, but to:
- Build **strong problem-solving intuition**
- Practice **standard CP patterns**
- Maintain **clean, explainable solutions** for future revision

---

## 📌 About CP-31 Sheet

The CP-31 Sheet is a well-known curated list of competitive programming problems designed to:
- Strengthen **core algorithms & data structures**
- Cover **common CP patterns**
- Prepare for **coding interviews and contests**

---
